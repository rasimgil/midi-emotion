Generates multi-instrument symbolic music (MIDI), based on user-provided emotions from valence-arousal plane. In simpler words, it can generate happy (positive valence, positive arousal), calm (positive valence, negative arousal), angry (negative valence, positive arousal) or sad (negative valence, negative arousal) music.

- Extract when necessary, and place all inside folder ```./data_files```

- Get Spotify client ID and client secret:
https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications
Then, fill in the variables "client_id" and "client_secret" in ```src/create_dataset/utils.py```

- Run ```run.py```. 

To preprocess and create the training dataset:

- Go to the ```src/data``` folder and run ```preprocess_pianorolls.py```


To generate MIDI using pretrained models:

- Download model(s) from the following link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R5-HaXmNzXBAhGq1idrDF-YEKkZm5C8C?usp=sharing

- Extract into the folder ```output```

- Go to ```src``` folder and run ```generate.py``` with appropriate arguments. e.g:
```python generate.py --model_dir continuous_concat --conditioning continuous_concat --valence -0.8, -0.8 0.8 0.8 --arousal -0.8 -0.8 0.8 0.8```


To train:

- Go to ```src``` folder and run ```train.py``` with appropriate arguments. e.g:
```python train.py --conditioning continuous_concat```

There are 4 different conditioning modes:
```none```: No conditioning, vanilla model.
```discrete_token```: Conditioning using discrete tokens, i.e. control tokens.
```continuous_token```: Conditioning using continuous values embedded as vectors, then prepended to the other embedded tokens in sequence dimension.
```continuous_concat```: Conditioning using continuous values embedded as vectors, then concatenated to all other embedded tokens in channel dimension.

See ```config.py``` for all options.
